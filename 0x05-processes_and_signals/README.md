### 0. What is my PID
- `0-what-is-my-pid` - a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes
- `1-list_your_processes` - a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

### 2. Show your Bash PID
- `2-show_your_bash_pid` -  a Bash script that displays lines containing the `bash` word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy
- `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` - a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash`.

### 4. To infinity and beyond
- `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` - a Bash script that displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely.

### 7. Highlander

### 8-beheaded_process
- `8-beheaded_process` - a Bash script that kills the process `7-highlander`.

### 9. Process and PID file
- `100-process_and_pid_file`
        - Creates the file `/var/run/myscript.pid` containing its PID
        - Displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely
        - Displays `I hate the kill command` when receiving a SIGTERM signal
        - Displays `Y U no love me?!` when receiving a SIGINT signal
        - Deletes the file `/var/run/myscript.pid` and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal
