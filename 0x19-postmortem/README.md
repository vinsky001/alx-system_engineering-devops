## Issue Summary
**Duration**August 12, 2023, 14:30 - 18:15 (UTC-4)
**Impact**Service outage affecting our Web Application, resulting in a 40% reduction in user accessibility and slow performance for remaining users.

### Timeline:
- 14:30: Issue detected as monitoring alerts triggered for increased latency and error rates.
- 14:35: Engineering team notified of the alerts and began investigating.
- 14:45: Initial assumption of high traffic load due to a new feature release.
- 15:00: Load balancers and server logs analyzed to identify any anomalies.
- 15:30: Misleading path: Assumed database performance issues due to slow queries.
- 16:00: Incident escalated to Database team for further investigation.
- 16:30: Database team confirmed no significant database load or slow queries.
- 17:00: Additional analysis revealed unusual patterns in outbound network traffic.
- 17:15: Escalated to Network Operations team for assistance.
- 17:30: Root cause identified: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting our DNS servers.
- 17:45: DNS traffic rerouted and DDoS mitigation measures implemented.
- 18:00: Service stability restored; traffic and error rates returned to normal.
- 18:15: Incident declared resolved; post-incident analysis initiated.

#Root Cause and Resolution

#Root Cause
The outage was caused by a targeted DDoS attack on our DNS servers. The attack overwhelmed our DNS infrastructure, leading to DNS resolution failures and effectively rendering the web application inaccessible to a significant portion of users.

#Resolution
To mitigate the DDoS attack, our Network Operations team rerouted DNS traffic through a third-party DDoS protection service. This external service effectively filtered and absorbed malicious traffic, allowing legitimate DNS requests to reach our servers. Additionally, traffic scrubbing rules were implemented to identify and block further attack vectors.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
### Improvements/Fixes:
1. Enhance DNS infrastructure with redundant servers and scalable load balancing.
2. Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for incoming DNS requests.
3. Establish monitoring for abnormal network traffic patterns to detect and respond to attacks.

#Tasks
1. Update DNS Infrastructure:

2. Deploy redundant DNS servers across multiple geographical regions.
3. Configure load balancers to distribute incoming DNS requests evenly.
4. Anomaly Detection and Rate Limiting:

 Integrate anomaly detection mechanisms to identify sudden spikes in DNS requests.
 Implement rate limiting rules to prevent excessive requests from a single source.
5. Network Traffic Monitoring:

Set up real-time network traffic monitoring with alerts for abnormal patterns.
Integrate with automated incident response to trigger DDoS mitigation measures.
6. Communication and Incident Response:

Establish clear communication channels and escalation paths for future incidents.
Develop incident response playbooks to ensure efficient and coordinated actions.
